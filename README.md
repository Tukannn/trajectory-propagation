# Satellite moon fly-by trajectory propagation

This script shows how to model and visualize a physical system using differential equations and animation in matlab. It can be used as a learning tool or a starting point for higher fidelity models.

It simulates the motion of a satellite on a fly-by trajectory and the Moon around the Earth using the gravitational force law. It also creates a GIF that shows the animation of the simulation.

It also finds and displays the closest approach distance between the satellite and the moon.
